`aequitas` is an open-source bias auditing and Fair ML toolkit for data scientists, machine learning researchers, and policymakers. We provide an easy-to-use and transparent tool for auditing predictors of ML models, as well as experimenting with "correcting biased model" using Fair ML methods in binary classification settings.

For more context around dealing with bias and fairness issues in AI//ML systems, take a look at our [detailed tutorial](https://dssg.github.io/fairness_tutorial/) and related publications.

### üîç Quickstart on Bias Auditing

To perform a bias audit, you need a pandas `DataFrame` with the following format:

|     | label | score | sens_attr_1 | sens_attr_2 | ... | sens_attr_N |
|-----|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| 0   | 0     | 0     | A           | F           |     | Y           |
| 1   | 0     | 1     | C           | F           |     | N           |
| 2   | 1     | 1     | B           | T           |     | N           |
| ... |       |       |             |             |     |             |
| N   | 1     | 0     | E           | T           |     | Y           |

where `label` is the target variable for your prediction task and `score` is the model output.
Only one sensitive attribute is required; all must be in `Categorical` format.

```python
from aequitas import Audit

audit = Audit(df)
```

To obtain a summary of the bias audit, run:
```python
# Select the fairness metric of interest for your dataset
audit.summary_plot(["tpr", "fpr", "pprev"])
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dssg/aequitas/master/docs/_images/summary_chart.svg" width="900">

We can also observe a single metric and sensitive attribute:
```python
audit.disparity_plot(attribute="sens_attr_2", metrics=["fpr"])
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dssg/aequitas/master/docs/_images/disparity_chart.svg" width="900">

### üß™ Quickstart on experimenting with Bias Reduction (Fair ML) methods

To perform an experiment, a dataset is required. It must have a label column, a sensitive attribute column, and features.  

```python
from aequitas.flow import DefaultExperiment

experiment = DefaultExperiment.from_pandas(dataset, target_feature="label", sensitive_feature="attr", experiment_size="small")
experiment.run()

experiment.plot_pareto()
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dssg/aequitas/master/docs/_images/pareto_example.png" width="600">

The [`DefaultExperiment`](https://github.com/dssg/aequitas/blob/readme-feedback-changes/src/aequitas/flow/experiment/default.py#L9) class allows for an easier entry-point to experiments in the package. This class has two main parameters to configure the experiment: `experiment_size` and `methods`. The former defines the size of the experiment, which can be either `test` (1 model per method), `small` (10 models per method), `medium` (50 models per method), or `large` (100 models per method). The latter defines the methods to be used in the experiment, which can be either `all` or a subset, namely `preprocessing` or `inprocessing`.

Several aspects of an experiment (*e.g.*, algorithms, number of runs, dataset splitting) can be configured individually in more granular detail in the [`Experiment`](https://github.com/dssg/aequitas/blob/readme-feedback-changes/src/aequitas/flow/experiment/experiment.py#L23) class.


[comment]: <> (Make default experiment this easy to run)

### üß† Quickstart on Method Training

Assuming an `aequitas.flow.Dataset`, it is possible to train methods and use their functionality depending on the type of algorithm (pre-, in-, or post-processing).

For pre-processing methods:
```python
from aequitas.flow.methods.preprocessing import PrevalenceSampling

sampler = PrevalenceSampling()
sampler.fit(dataset.train.X, dataset.train.y, dataset.train.s)
X_sample, y_sample, s_sample = sampler.transform(dataset.train.X, dataset.train.y, dataset.train.s)
```

for in-processing methods:
```python
from aequitas.flow.methods.inprocessing import FairGBM

model = FairGBM()
model.fit(X_sample, y_sample, s_sample)
scores_val = model.predict_proba(dataset.validation.X, dataset.validation.y, dataset.validation.s)
scores_test = model.predict_proba(dataset.test.X, dataset.test.y, dataset.test.s)
```

for post-processing methods:
```python
from aequitas.flow.methods.postprocessing import BalancedGroupThreshold

threshold = BalancedGroupThreshold("top_pct", 0.1, "fpr")
threshold.fit(dataset.validation.X, scores_val, dataset.validation.y, dataset.validation.s)
corrected_scores = threshold.transform(dataset.test.X, scores_test, dataset.test.s)
```

With this sequence, we would sample a dataset, train a FairGBM model, and then adjust the scores to have equal FPR per group (achieving Predictive Equality).

## üìú Features of the Toolkit
- **Metrics**: Audits based on confusion matrix-based metrics with flexibility to select the more important ones depending on use-case.
- **Plotting options**: The major outcomes of bias auditing and experimenting offer also plots adequate to different user objectives. 
- **Fair ML methods**: Interface and implementation of several Fair ML methods, including pre-, in-, and post-processing methods.
- **Datasets**: Two "families" of datasets included, named [BankAccountFraud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13358) and [FolkTables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04884).
- **Extensibility**: Adapted to receive user-implemented methods, with intuitive interfaces and method signatures.
- **Reproducibility**: Option to save artifacts of Experiments, from the transformed data to the fitted models and predictions.
- **Modularity**: Fair ML Methods and default datasets can be used individually or integrated in an `Experiment`.
- **Hyperparameter optimization**: Out of the box integration and abstraction of [Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna)'s hyperparameter optimization capabilities for experimentation.

### Fairness Metrics

`aequitas` provides the value of confusion matrix metrics for each possible value of the sensitive attribute columns To calculate fairness metrics. The cells of the confusion metrics are:

| Cell               | Symbol  | Description                                                    | 
|--------------------|:-------:|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **False Positive** | $FP_g$  | The number of entities of the group with $\hat{Y}=1$ and $Y=0$ |
| **False Negative** | $FN_g$  | The number of entities of the group with $\hat{Y}=0$ and $Y=1$ |
| **True Positive**  | $TP_g$  | The number of entities of the group with $\hat{Y}=1$ and $Y=1$ |
| **True Negative**  | $TN_g$  | The number of entities of the group with $\hat{Y}=0$ and $Y=0$ |

From these, we calculate several metrics:

| Metric                        | Formula                                             | Description                                                                               | 
|-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| **Accuracy**                  | $Acc_g = \cfrac{TP_g + TN_g}{\|g\|}$                | The fraction of correctly predicted entities withing the group.                           |
| **True Positive Rate**        | $TPR_g = \cfrac{TP_g}{TP_g + FN_g}$                 | The fraction of true positives within the label positive entities of a group.             |
| **True Negative Rate**        | $TNR_g = \cfrac{TN_g}{TN_g + FP_g}$                 | The fraction of true negatives within the label negative entities of a group.             |
| **False Negative Rate**       | $FNR_g = \cfrac{FN_g}{TP_g + FN_g}$                 | The fraction of false negatives within the label positive entities of a group.            |
| **False Positive Rate**       | $FPR_g = \cfrac{FP_g}{TN_g + FP_g}$                 | The fraction of false positives within the label negative entities of a group.            |
| **Precision**                 | $Precision_g = \cfrac{TP_g}{TP_g + FP_g}$           | The fraction of true positives within the predicted positive entities of a group.         |
| **Negative Predictive Value** | $NPV_g = \cfrac{TN_g}{TN_g + FN_g}$                 | The fraction of true negatives within the predicted negative entities of a group.         | 
| **False Discovery Rate**      | $FDR_g = \cfrac{FP_g}{TP_g + FP_g}$                 | The fraction of false positives within the predicted positive entities of a group.        |
| **False Omission Rate**       | $FOR_g = \cfrac{FN_g}{TN_g + FN_g}$                 | The fraction of false negatives within the predicted negative entities of a group.        |
| **Predicted Positive**        | $PP_g = TP_g + FP_g$                                |  The number of entities within a group where the decision is positive, i.e., $\hat{Y}=1$. |
| **Total Predictive Positive** | $K = \sum PP_{g(a_i)}$                              | The total number of entities predicted positive across groups defined by $A$              | 
| **Predicted Negative**        | $PN_g = TN_g + FN_g$                                | The number of entities within a group where the decision is negative, i.e., $\hat{Y}=0$   | 
| **Predicted Prevalence**      | $Pprev_g=\cfrac{PP_g}{\|g\|}=P(\hat{Y}=1 \| A=a_i)$ | The fraction of entities within a group which were predicted as positive.                 | 
| **Predicted Positive Rate**   | $PPR_g = \cfrac{PP_g}{K} = P(A=A_i \| \hat{Y}=1)$   | The fraction of the entities predicted as positive that belong to a certain group.        | 

These are implemented in the [`Group`](https://github.com/dssg/aequitas/blob/master/src/aequitas/group.py) class. With the [`Bias`](https://github.com/dssg/aequitas/blob/master/src/aequitas/bias.py) class, several fairness metrics can be derived by different combinations of ratios of these metrics.
