See Aequitas in action in our series of Google Colab example notebooks:

- `Audit a Model's Predictions <https://colab.research.google.com/github/dssg/aequitas/blob/notebooks/compas_demo.ipynb>`_ : Check how to do an in-depth bias audit with the COMPAS example notebook or use your own data. 
- `Correct a Model's Predictions <https://colab.research.google.com/github/dssg/aequitas/blob/notebooks/aequitas_flow_model_audit_and_correct.ipynb>`_ :  Create a dataframe to audit a specific model, and correct the predictions with group-specific thresholds in the Model correction notebook. 
- `Train a Model with Fairness Considerations <https://colab.research.google.com/github/dssg/aequitas/blob/notebooks/aequitas_flow_experiment.ipynb>`_ :  Experiment with your own dataset or methods and check the results of a Fair ML experiment. 
- `Add your method to Aequitas Flow <https://colab.research.google.com/github/dssg/aequitas/blob/notebooks/aequitas_flow_add_method.ipynb>`_ :  Learn how to add your own method to the Aequitas Flow toolkit.
