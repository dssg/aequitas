    "You can audit your risk assessment system for two types of biases:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Biased actions or interventions that are not allocated in a way that’s representative of the population.\n",
    " - Biased outcomes through actions or interventions that are a result of your system being wrong about certain groups of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both audits, you need the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Data about the specific attributes (race, gender, age, income, etc.) you want to audit for the the overall population considered for interventions\n",
    "\n",
    " - The set of individuals in the above population that your risk assessment system recommended/ selected for intervention or action. _It’s important t this set come from the assessments made after the system has been built, and not from the data the machine learning system was “trained” on if you're using the audit as a factor in model selection._\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to audit for biases due to model or system errors, you also need to include actual outcomes (label values) for all individuals in the overall population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Input data has slightly different requirements depending on whether you are using Aequitas via the webapp, CLI or Python package. In general, input data is a single table with the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `score`\n",
    "- `label_value` (for error-based metrics only)\n",
    "- at least one attribute e.g. `race`, `sex` and `age_cat` (attribute categories defined by user)"
